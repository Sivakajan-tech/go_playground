# Go Playground

This repository contains a Go application that provides a basic RESTful API for managing users. The application connects to a MySQL database and is designed to help familiarize you with Golang and Docker technologies.

## Applications

1. **[User Management CRUD API](<./crud_rest_api>)**  
   A RESTful API that handles the following operations:

   - Create new users
   - Retrieve user information
   - Update existing users
   - Delete users

2. **[Event Driven Programming with Kafka](<./kafka>)**  
   A event-driven programming using Go and Kafka.

   - Understanding Kafka’s role in event-driven systems
   - Enhancing communication between microservices
   - Asynchronous processing using Kafka streams
   - Building producers and consumers in Go
   - Exploring Kafka’s fault tolerance and scalability

3. **[Load Balancer](<./load_balancer>)**  
   A round-robin based load balancer implementation in Go.

   - Distributingtraffic using round-robin algorithm
   - Reverse proxying requests to backend servers
   - Implementing custom server health checks
   - Leveraging Go's net/http and httputil packages
   - Managing and balancing traffic across multiple services
  
4. **More Applications Coming Soon**  
   This repository will be expanded with additional Go applications to practice and explore more features and technologies, such as:
   - WebSocket applications
   - Background job processing
   - Advanced database interactions
   - Cloud deployment integration
